We have arrived at a very interesting point in our discussion,
and one that is completely contradictory to all of the alternative
solutions to the problem of the origin of consciousness which we
discussed in the introductory chapter. For if consciousness is
based on language, then it follows that it is of a much more
recent origin than has heretofore been supposed. Consciousness
come after language! The implications of such a position are
extremely serious.
