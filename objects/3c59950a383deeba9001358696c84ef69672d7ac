% We use a name other than `sympytex' because when using the sympytex
% package in a file called `foo.dtx', a file `foo.py' will be produced
% -- and below, we generate a file called sympytex.py. Thus we use a name
% other than `sympytex.dtx' so that building the documentation doesn't
% clobber the very Python file we need to build the documentation!

\generate{\file{sympytex.sty}{\from{sympytexpackage.dtx}{latex}}}


% Some trickery to get triple quotes around the {pre,post}amble. This is
% a modification of what the Docstrip manual suggests; their method
% resulted in some bits being printed twice because, I think, of a
% problem in \declare{pre,post}amble. At any rate, this gives us a
% properly commented Python file with the same preamble as the .sty
% file.
