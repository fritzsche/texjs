% Being a rather high level package, several over-all styling options
% are set to new defaults. This includes several spacings, numbering
% schemes etc. Currently, the most important changes are the
% following:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item We redefine \verb|\mathbb| to use the fonts from the |bbm|
%     package, looks so much nicer: $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{C}$ but
%     also $\mathbb{k}$.
% \item We redefine |\mathcal| to use the font |EulerScript| from the
%     |euler| package yielding $\mathcal{CLO}$ and we define
%     |\mathsrc| to use the script font |rsfso| from the |rfsfo|
%     package giving $\mathscr{ABCD}$. Please make sure that these
%     fonts are installed properly: with a recent \LaTeX-installation
%     this should be automatic.
% \item Equation numbers are always with sections in front. In the
%     |book| class this leads to equation numbers having the chapter
%     number and the section number in front.
% \item Displayed formulas are allowed to break over pages. As in
%     mathematical texts one has many (many!) long formulas this is
%     really necessary. Without allowing this by default a case by
%     case decision typically leads to sub-optimal results in page
%     breaks.
% \item We set |\arraystretch| to the value |1.2| to have a bit more
%     space in arrays.
% \item The |\left| and the |\right| commands in math mode have a
%     notoriously bad spacing. This is fixed by a hack from
%     TexExchange.
% \item The command |\cleardoublepage| will produce empty headers on
%     an empty left page. This will only affect the behaviour in
%     classes with left/right pages like the book class. It generally
%     looks weird to have an empty left page containing just the page
%     number or some default header but nothing else.
% \end{itemize}
