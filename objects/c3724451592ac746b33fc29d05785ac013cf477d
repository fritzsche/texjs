% \subsubsection{The Predefined Environments}
%\label{sec:doc_PredefinedEnvironments}
%
% The following theorem-like environments will be defined as standards
% as they will be needed anyway. We use the |ntheorem| package
% to do this and load it automatically with several options. Hence you
% should not load it by hand with other options.
%
%
\DescribeEnv{claim}
\DescribeEnv{corollary}
\DescribeEnv{definition}
\DescribeEnv{lemma}
\DescribeEnv{proposition}
\DescribeEnv{theorem}
% As usually needed we define the standard mathematical environments
% |claim|, |corollary|, |definition|, |lemma|, |proposition|, and
% |theorem| with a common appearance: titles in bold, body in
% italic. The numbering will use a common counter including the
% section counter.
%
%
\DescribeEnv{conjecture}
\DescribeEnv{convention}
\DescribeEnv{example}
\DescribeEnv{notation}
\DescribeEnv{question}
\DescribeEnv{remark}
% The environments |conjecture|, |example|, |notation|, |question|,
% and |remark| use the same counter as the above ones but have a body
% in roman.
%
%
\DescribeEnv{exercise}
% The environment |exercise| has its own counter including the section
% and is set in roman.
%
%
\DescribeEnv{maintheorem}
% We have a |maintheorem| environment which has no numbering at all:
% this is useful for papers where there is one and only one main
% theorem you want to place at a particular place, say in the
% introduction.
%
%
\DescribeEnv{nn<environment>}
% For all these environments there is a non-numbered version |nn<environment>|.
% So one can use e.g. |\begin{nntheorem} ... \end{nntheorem}| to get the theorem
% environment as above, but without numbering.
%
% These environments are compatible with |autoref|.  Hence using
% \begin{quote}
%     |\autoref{label_to_<env-name>}|
% \end{quote}
% will give a linked reference to the
% environment labelled with
% \begin{quote}
%     |\label{label_to_<env-name>}|
% \end{quote}
% with a prefix depending on the type of environment.  This also works
% for chapters, sections, etc.
% For non-numbered environments one should still use |\ref|.
%
%
\DescribeEnv{proof}
\DescribeEnv{subproof}
% We have a |proof| and a |subproof| environment with an automatic
% tombstone sign at their ends. The location of the tombstone signs is
% maintained by the |ntheorem| package in a really good way. The
% |proof| environment finishes with a box sign, the subproof with
% $\triangledown$.  The only catch is that one should not use the
% commands |\[| and |\]| for equations without numbers in the proof
% environment anymore: this causes errors as soon as one wants to
% place a |\tag{$*$}| for these equations. Instead, one can achieve
% this as follows:
% \begin{center}
%     \begin{tabular}[l]{p{0.8\textwidth}}
%         |\begin{equation*}| \\
%             |    E = mc^2|\\
%             |    \tag{$*$}|\\
%             |\end{equation*}|
%     \end{tabular}
% \end{center}
% It seems that also some float environments (like |figure| or
% |table|) at the end of the proof confuse the |ntheorem| package: you
% should avoid this by placing the float outside of the |proof|
% environment.
%
%
\DescribeEnv{hint}
% We have a |hint| environment to be used inside exercises: set in a
% very small font and without numbering.
%
%
\DescribeEnv{<environment>list}
% We have special list environments |claimlist|, |conjecturelist|, |conventionlist|,
% |corollarylist|, |definitionlist|, |examplelist|, |exerciselist|,
% |lemmalist|, |maintheoremlist|, |notationlist|, |propositionlist|,
% |questionlist|, |remarklist|,  |theoremlist| and |prooflist| corresponding to the
% above mathematical environments. They allow to control the
% appearance of the item lists individually. The items will be
% numbered in italic and can be referred to using the command
% |\ref{item:MyLabel}|.  Currently, all the lists are styled the same
% way, but this can individually be changed easily. The lists are
% build using the |enumitem| package.
% You can use all options that are available by the |enumitem| package
% also for these lists.
%
%
% \DescribeEnv{cptenum}
% \DescribeEnv{cptitem}
% \DescribeEnv{cptdesc}
% Beside these mathematical environments we also provide generic
% compact lists: |cptenum|, |cptitem|, and |cptdesc| similar to the
% lists from the |paralist| package.
