Sources for TeX4ht, https://tug.org/tex4ht.

Eitan Gurari (the original author of tex4ht) devised his own literate
programming system, which supports multiple output files from a single
source (https://ctan.org/pkg/protex). The files here are such "literate"
source files. They are processed with (ht)(la)tex, as given by commands
at the top of each file and in the Makefile.

The extra-bin subdirectory contains do-nothing scripts named xmllint
and vcss, which are called for validation via tex4ht-env.tex.  (Of
course they won't be used unless ./extra-bin is early enough in PATH.)
The real xmllint can take a long time to run, and fails to find the
DTD on the tex4ht-docbook*.html output.

The Makefile has commands to build the derived files (e.g., *.4ht) from
the *.tex sources, compare them against an installed system, etc.  Much
work remains to be done to make it a clean build, but it's a start.

Bug reports and patches are most welcome. See https://tug.org/tex4ht
for contact and other information.
