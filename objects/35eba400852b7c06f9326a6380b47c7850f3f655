% \DescribeMacro{\nchairxheader}
% The \textsf{nChairX} package provides two macros for your personal
% logo. With
% \begin{center}
%     \begin{tabular}[l]{p{0.8\textwidth}}
%         \verb|\nchairxheader|
%     \end{tabular}
% \end{center}
% you obtain a header logo with the full textwidth. It uses the file
% |nchairxheader.pdf| which has to be in your \LaTeX{} search path.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\nchairxlogo}
% The other logo \verb|\nchairxlogo| is smaller and can be used with a
% specific width as argument. It includes the file |nchairxlogo.pdf| which 
% has to be in the search path as well. The argument is the width in a valid
% \LaTeX{} unit producing e.g. \nchairxlogo{3em}.
