\addchap{Preface to \KOMAScript~3.46}

While working on \KOMAScript{} 3.46, I received the bad news that Axel
Sommerfeldt intends to discontinue maintenance of the \Package{caption}
package and will therefore no longer accept suggestions for changes and
improvements. This is relevant for \KOMAScript{} insofar as, after some
improvements to \Macro{caption} processing, it became apparent that
\Package{caption} also needs some minor changes to maintain and improve
compatibility with \KOMAScript{}. Under no circumstances should improvements
to \Macro{caption} processing within \KOMAScript{} have a negative impact on
the compatibility of the \Package{caption} package. The consequence is that
the \Package{caption} package itself no longer ensures compatibility, but
rather \KOMAScript{} reacts to the loading of \Package{caption} in order to
then establish compatibility itself.

As in many other cases, this naturally means more work for me in terms of both
development and testing. Together with the countless changes that have
recently become necessary due to the rapid development of \LaTeX{} itself,
this unfortunately means that some urgent work on \KOMAScript{} is constantly
being put on hold. Several other projects, which are ultimately becoming
increasingly important for the continued existence of \KOMAScript{}, could not
be worked on again. Unfortunately, this also includes tagging support.

Nevertheless, this version of \KOMAScript{} has succeeded in further advancing
the urgently needed revision of the distribution of tasks between classes and
packages. A few other problems have also been addressed, but these may lead to
changed page breaks in two-column documents with chapter headings. See the
website »\href{https://sourceforge.net/p/koma-script/wiki-en/Releases/}
{Important notes and changes}« and, in particular,
»\href{https://sourceforge.net/p/koma-script/wiki-en/Release%203.46/}
{Known issues and important changes in \KOMAScript{} 3.46}«.

My thanks go mainly to my wife. She cushions all my unpleasant experiences on
the Internet. She has also put up with me for more than 30~years when I am
once again unresponsive because I am completely immersed in \KOMAScript{} or
some \LaTeX{} problems. The fact that I can afford to invest such an insane
amount of time in a project like this is also thanks to my wife alone.
