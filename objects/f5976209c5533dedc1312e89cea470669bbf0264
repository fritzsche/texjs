% We use the |tensor| package and modify things slightly to fit our
% needs: we provide a decoration command that allows to decorate
% arbitrary math symbols from left and right, top and bottom with
% other math symbols. This can be used to produce tensors with many
% indices. However, this is far too useful to be restricted to tensors
% only. The original |\tensor| macro from the |tensor package| is
% still available under the name |\originaltensor|. Note, that the 
% |\tensor| command in |nchairx| is intended for the symbol of tensor
% product, and not for decorating a symbol with indices.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\decorate}
% Decorate a symbol from all sides. The option argument gives the
% decoration in front of the symbol, the first argument the symbol,
% the second (mandatory) argument the decoration after the symbol. For
% each decoration several superscripts and subscripts can be used like
% |\decorate[^a_b^c]{S}{_d^{rt}_e}|:
% $\decorate[^a_b^c]{S}{_d^{rt}_e}$.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\deco}
% We also provide a simpler version of |\decorate| called |\deco|
% which takes five usual arguments and sets them as sub- and
% superscripts before and after the middle symbol
% |\deco{a}{b}{c}{d}{e}|:$\deco{a}{b}{c}{d}{e}$ This can be used to
% define your own macros with decoration.  E.g. for bimodules over
% rings one could define
% |\newcommand{\bimodule}[3]{\deco{}{\ring{#1}{\module{#2}}{}{\ring{#3}}}}|
% which can then be used as |\bimodule{R}{E}{S}|:
% $\deco{}{\ring{R}}{\module{E}}{}{\ring{S}}$.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\script}
% Sets the argument in the |scriptfont| and hence allows to create macros
% with fonts consistent with the other |nchairx| macros.
